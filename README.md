# oh-my-docker (omdocker)

A keyboard-driven Docker TUI (Terminal User Interface) written in Rust.

Fast, minimal, and built for ops workflows — inspired by k9s, lazygit, and htop.

## Quick Start

Download binary from [github releases](https://github.com/supertorpe/oh-my-docker/releases)

...or build it yourself:
```bash
cargo build --release
```
...or build it yourself with Docker:
```bash
mkdir -p .cache && docker run --rm \
	-u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
	-v $PWD:/volume \
	-v $PWD/.cache:/usr/local/cargo/registry \
	-w /volume \
	rust:slim-bookworm \
	cargo build --release
```
Run:
```bash
./target/release/omdocker
```

Requires Docker to be installed and the user to have access to the Docker socket.

## Features

- **Container list** — browse running/stopped containers with fuzzy search, optional initial filter via CLI arg
- **Container details** — inspect metadata, env, volumes, networks, ports, labels; scrollable with `j`/`k`/`PgUp`/`PgDn`
- **Multi-select mode** — press `Space` to enter selection mode, select individual containers, batch start/stop/delete
- **Live logs** — streaming with follow mode, pause, search, scroll, jump-to-top/bottom, timestamp toggle (`T`), export to file (`Ctrl+S`)
- **Shell access** — `docker exec -it` inside any container with configurable shell (`sh`, `bash`, `/bin/zsh`), user (container default, `root`, `host` → `uid:gid`, or custom `user:group`), and working directory. Config per container is persisted to `~/.config/omdocker/omdocker.toml`. TUI suspends, shell runs in the parent terminal, TUI resumes on exit.
- **Image management** — list, remove, run containers from images with configurable command/env/ports/volumes/name/auto-remove and inline validation
- **Dangling/prune images** — remove dangling (`<none>`) images with `D`, prune all unused images with `p`
- **Docker events** — real-time event stream with type filtering, scroll, export, pause, and emoji icons
- **Statistics** — live `docker stats` view with CPU %, memory, network I/O, block I/O, PIDs; sortable by column with `←`/`→`, toggle direction with `t`
- **Networks** — list and delete Docker networks
- **Volumes** — list and delete Docker volumes
- **Container lifecycle** — start, stop (shows "stopping..."), restart, delete (shows "deleting...") with confirmation dialogs
- **Docker reconnection** — automatic periodic reconnection with visual feedback when Docker is unavailable
- **Persistent errors** — red error toasts for critical messages, dismiss with any key; auto-dismissing info toasts
- **Self-update** — background check for new versions on startup (configurable), `U` to check/download, auto-replaces binary
- **Keyboard-first** — all actions available via keys, no mouse needed
- **Fast** — async polling, non-blocking UI, ring buffers for logs/events
- **CLI** — `--help`/`-h` and `--version`/`-V` flags

## Architecture

omdocker follows a unidirectional data flow:

```
Terminal input → AppEvent → Reducer → AppState → UI render
```

Async Docker operations (container polling, log streaming, event streaming) run on
background tokio tasks and communicate with the main loop via `mpsc` channels.

Each screen is an independent `Mode` in a state machine. Navigation between screens
uses a `ModeStack` (max depth 10) for back-button support. Destructive actions
(delete, remove) show a confirmation dialog before executing.

Shell access suspends the TUI entirely: the terminal exits raw mode/alternate screen,
`docker exec -it` runs as a blocking child process in the parent terminal, and on
exit the TUI re-initializes and resumes. Containers created with `--rm` are
automatically stopped on shell exit via `stop_on_exit`. Per-container shell
preferences (shell, user, workdir) are persisted to `~/.config/omdocker/omdocker.toml`.
