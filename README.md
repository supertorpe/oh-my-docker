# oh-my-docker (omdocker)

A keyboard-driven Docker TUI (Terminal User Interface) written in Rust.

Fast, minimal, and built for ops workflows — inspired by k9s, lazygit, and htop.

## Quick Start

Download binary from [github releases](https://github.com/supertorpe/oh-my-docker/releases)

...or build it yourself:
```bash
cargo build --release
```
...or build it yourself with Docker:
```bash
mkdir -p .cache && docker run --rm \
	-u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
	-v $PWD:/volume \
	-v $PWD/.cache:/usr/local/cargo/registry \
	-w /volume \
	rust:slim-bookworm \
	cargo build --release
```
Run:
```bash
./target/release/omdocker
```

You can also pass an optional filter argument to pre-filter containers on startup:
```bash
./target/release/omdocker my-service
```

Requires Docker to be installed and the user to have access to the Docker socket.

## Features

- **Container list** — browse running/stopped containers with fuzzy search, optional initial filter via CLI arg
- **Context menus** — right-click on containers for quick access to details, logs, shell, explorer, start/stop, delete. Right-click in file explorer for copy, preview, rename, delete
- **Container details** — inspect metadata, env, volumes, networks, ports, labels; scrollable with `j`/`k`/`PgUp`/`PgDn`
- **Multi-select mode** — press `Space` to enter selection mode, select individual containers, batch start/stop/delete
- **Column picker** — hide/show columns in containers, images, networks, and volumes with `Ctrl+O`
- **Live logs** — streaming with follow mode, pause/resume (`Space`/`p`), reconnect (`r`), search (`/`), scroll, jump-to-top/bottom, timestamp toggle (`T`), export to file (`s`/`Ctrl+S`)
- **Shell access** — `docker exec -it` inside any container with configurable shell (`sh`, `bash`, `/bin/zsh`), user (`root`, `host` → `uid:gid`, or custom `user:group`), and working directory. Config per container persisted to `~/.config/omdocker/omdocker.toml`. TUI suspends, shell runs in the parent terminal, TUI resumes on exit
- **Container file explorer** — browse and transfer files between host and container (`x` to open, `Tab` to switch panels, `Ctrl+C` to copy, `r` to rename, `d` to delete, `R` to refresh)
- **Volume file explorer** — browse Docker volume contents via an ephemeral helper container (`alpine` with `sleep 86400`, created once and reused). Two-panel layout: host filesystem (left) and volume filesystem (right). Supports directory navigation, file delete/rename, refreshing
- **Image management** — list, remove, run containers from images with a configurable run form (command, env, ports, volumes, name, auto-remove, restart policy, memory/CPU limits, network, labels, privileged mode) with inline validation
- **Dangling/prune images** — remove dangling (`<none>`) images with `D`, prune all unused images with `p`
- **Docker events** — real-time event stream with type filtering, scrolling, jump-to-top/bottom
- **Statistics** — live `docker stats` view with CPU %, memory, network I/O, block I/O, PIDs; sortable by column with `←`/`→`, toggle direction with `t`
- **Networks** — list and delete Docker networks with column picker
- **Volumes** — list and delete Docker volumes with column picker
- **Container lifecycle** — start, stop (shows "stopping..."), restart, delete (shows "deleting...") with confirmation dialogs
- **AI diagnostics** — one-key diagnostics (`D`) compiles container context (recent logs, exit code, resource stats, config) and sends it to a local or cloud LLM for root-cause analysis and a repair playbook, displayed in a split side panel
- **Docker reconnection** — automatic periodic reconnection with visual feedback when Docker is unavailable
- **Persistent errors** — red error toasts for critical messages, dismiss with any key; auto-dismissing info toasts
- **Self-update** — background check for new versions on startup (configurable), `U` to check/download, auto-replaces binary
- **Configurable** — polling intervals, column visibility, and keybindings in `~/.config/omdocker/omdocker.toml`
- **Keyboard-first** — all actions available via keys, mouse scrolling supported in explorer panels and scrollable views
- **Fast** — async polling, non-blocking UI, ring buffers for logs/events
- **CLI** — `--help`/`-h`, `--version`/`-V`, and optional filter argument `<search_text>`

| Right-click | Open context menu (details, logs, shell, explorer, start/stop, delete) |

### Container Details

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `l` | Open logs |
| `s` | Open shell |
| `x` | Open file explorer |
| `r` | Restart container |
| `D` | AI diagnostics |
| `t` | Start/Stop container (context-sensitive) |
| `j` / `↑` | Scroll down |
| `k` / `↓` | Scroll up |
| `PgDn` | Scroll down 20 lines |
| `PgUp` | Scroll up 20 lines |
| `g` | Go to top |
| `G` | Go to bottom |
| `Esc` | Back to container list |

### AI Diagnostics

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `D` | Trigger diagnostics on selected container (from list or details view) |
| `D` / `Esc` | Close diagnostics and return to previous view |
| `j` / `↓` / `PgDn` | Scroll down |
| `k` / `↑` / `PgUp` | Scroll up |
| `g` | Jump to top |
| `G` | Jump to bottom |

Press `D` on any container to trigger AI diagnostics. omdocker compiles a
context vector — recent logs, exit code, resource stats (CPU/mem/net), environment
variables, and container config — and sends it to a configured LLM provider. Results
stream into a split panel: root-cause analysis on the left, step-by-step repair
playbook on the right.

**Requires a configured `[llm]` section in `~/.config/omdocker/omdocker.toml`:**
```toml
[llm]
provider = "ollama"     # or "openai", "anthropic"
model = "llama3"        # any model your provider supports
# base_url = "http://localhost:11434"   # override default endpoint
# api_key = "sk-..."                    # for cloud providers
```
If no `[llm]` section is configured, pressing `D` shows a dialog with setup
instructions. The config file is reloaded on each `D` press — edit the file
from another terminal and the changes take effect immediately without restart.

## Architecture

omdocker follows a unidirectional data flow:

```
Terminal input → AppEvent → Reducer → AppState → UI render
```

Async Docker operations (container polling, log streaming, event streaming) run on
background tokio tasks and communicate with the main loop via `mpsc` channels.

Each screen is an independent `Mode` in a state machine. Navigation between screens
uses a `ModeStack` (max depth 10) for back-button support. Destructive actions
(delete, remove) show a confirmation dialog before executing.

Shell access suspends the TUI entirely: the terminal exits raw mode/alternate screen,
`docker exec -it` runs as a blocking child process in the parent terminal, and on
exit the TUI re-initializes and resumes. Per-container shell preferences (shell,
user, workdir) are persisted to `~/.config/omdocker/omdocker.toml`.

The volume file explorer creates a lightweight helper container (`alpine:latest` with
`sleep 86400`) that mounts the target Docker volume. The container is created once and
reused across directory navigations for fast listing via `docker exec`. It is cleaned
up when leaving the volume explorer (via `Command::RemoveVolumeHelper`).

AI diagnostics compile a `DiagnosticContext` (logs, exit code, resource stats,
environment, config) and send it to a configured LLM via `curl`. The response is
parsed into structured `analysis` and `playbook` fields, rendered in a split panel
with severity-aware color coding.
